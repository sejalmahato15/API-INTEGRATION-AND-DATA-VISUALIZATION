*In this project, I developed a simple Python-based application to fetch and visualize real-time weather data using a public API. The main objective was to understand how APIs work and how data can be processed and represented visually.
I used the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather information such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed for multiple cities. The data was retrieved in JSON format using the requests library, and then relevant parameters were extracted and stored in Python lists.
For visualization, I used the matplotlib library to create different graphs. A bar chart was used to compare temperature across cities, and additional visualizations like line graphs and scatter plots were used to analyze pressure and wind speed patterns. This helped in understanding the variation in weather conditions between different locations.
This project also helped me learn basic Python concepts such as loops, lists, and working with dictionaries. The implementation is kept simple to focus on understanding the data flow from API to visualization.*
